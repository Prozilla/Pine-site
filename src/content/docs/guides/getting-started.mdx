## Introduction

Pine is an abbreviation for **P**rozilla's game eng**ine**.
Pine implements the [LWJGL](https://www.lwjgl.org/) library to enable cross-platform access to native API's like OpenGL, Vulkan, OpenAL, OpenCL and more.
It provides a high-level and developer-friendly framework on top of the native libraries that LWJGL provides.

## First steps

To get started with the Pine engine, please take a look at the [Installation guide](../installation).
After that, you can explore our documentation on this site and also via [Javadoc](https://javadoc.pine.prozilla.dev/).
You can also find a couple example projects in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Prozilla/Pine/tree/main/examples/src/main/java/dev/prozilla/pine/examples).
