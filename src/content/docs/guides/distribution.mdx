export const buildGradle = `
tasks.register("createExe") {
    doLast {
        def buildTask = tasks.getByPath(":pine:runBuildTool")
        buildTask.args = [projectDir.absolutePath] // Pass the project directory as an argument
        buildTask.exec()
    }
}`;

The Pine engine includes a build tool to distribute your games as executables, using [Launch4j](https://launch4j.sourceforge.net/). The build tool also bundles the resources and a JRE.

Before running the build tool, make sure you create a [configuration file](../../reference/configuration) for your application.

<Steps>

1. Build your project using `gradle build`.
2. Start the build tool with `gradle :pine:runBuildTool ROOT_DIR`. Replace `ROOT_DIR` with the root directory of your project, which should include your `pine-config.json` file.
3. Test your application by executing the `.exe` file in the subdirectory `/pine` inside your build directory.
4. To distribute your application, copy the entire parent directory of your `.exe` file, including the `/JRE` and `/resources` folder and the `version.txt` file.

</Steps>

## Gradle task

Alternatively, you can set up a gradle task to run the build tool with fewer steps:

<Steps>

1. Edit your `build.gradle` file and add the following lines:

	<Code code={buildGradle} title="build.gradle" lang="groovy" />

2. If you would like to automatically run the build tool every time your build your project, add the following line to `build.gradle`:

	<Code code={"tasks.named(\"build\") { finalizedBy(\"createExe\") }"} lang="groovy" />

3. To manually create an exe, run `gradle createExe`.

</Steps>
