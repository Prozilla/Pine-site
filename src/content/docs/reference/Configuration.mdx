import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { Badge } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

export const pineConfig = `{
  "mainClass": "org.example.Main",
  "gameName": "Game",
  "developer": "Developer",
  "version": "1.0.0.0",
  "jreVersion": "19",
  "iconPath": "resources/icon.ico",
}`;

You can configure the Pine engine inside the `pine-config.json` configuration file:

<Code
	code={pineConfig}
	title="pine-config.json"
	lang="json"
/>

Place this file at the root of your project. You can add the following options to your configuration file.

## `mainClass`

**Type:** `string`

Set the main class of your application.

## `gameName`

**Type:** `string`

Set the name of your application. This value must be a valid file name, as it will be used to generate the `.exe` file of your application.

## `developer`

**Type:** `string`

Set the name of developer of your application.

## `version`

**Type:** `string`

Set the version of your application. This value must match the pattern `x.x.x.x`, where `x` represents any number. The build tool will automatically add a `version.txt` file with the value of this option in your build.

## `jreVersion`

**Type:** `string`

Set the JRE version for your application. This value must be a valid JRE version and must be at least `19`.

## `iconPath`

**Type:** `string`

Set the path of the icon of your application. The icon file must be an `.ico` file.

## `debug` <Badge text="Optional" size="large" variant="tip" />

**Type:** `boolean`

**Default:** `false`

Enables debug mode for your application. If this value is set to `true`, running your application will also open a console window with the application's log output.
