Systems look for certain combinations of components in entities and modify the data of said components in each frame. Systems determine the behaviour of entities.

There are a total of 4 different types of systems:

| Order | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Initialisation systems | Initialize entities when they are first added to the world. |
| 2 | Input systems | Read user input and modify data of components in each frame. |
| 3 | Update systems | Modify the data of components in each frame. |
| 4 | Render systems | Turn components into visuals that are rendered to the screen. |

Initialisation systems are also executed when an inactive entity is re-activated. Input, update and render systems are executed in each frame in the order specified above.
