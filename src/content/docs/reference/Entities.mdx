Entities are unique elements inside a world that can have components. Every entity has a `Transform` component, which contains data about its position, parent and children.

## Prefabs

Entities can be created by instantiated prefabs into the world. Prefabs serve as a blueprint for entities, they determine which components an entity is initialized with, which tag, etc.

Here is an example:

<Steps>

1. Create a new sprite prefab.

	```java
	SpritePrefab spritePrefab = new SpritePrefab("sprite.png");
	```

2. Set properties of the prefab

	```java
	spritePrefab.setColor(new Color(1f, 1f, 1f, 0.5f));
	spritePrefab.setScale(2f);
	```

3. Instantiate the prefab

	```java
	Entity sprite = spritePrefab.instantiate(world);
	// Or
	Entity sprite = spritePrefab.instantiate(world, 0, 0);
	// Or
	Entity sprite = world.addEntity(spritePrefab);
	// Or
	Entity sprite = world.addEntity(spritePrefab, 0, 0);
	```

4. You will now have an entity at (0, 0) with a sprite component attached with a semi-transparent color and 2x scale.

</Steps>

Alternatively, if you want to add the entity as a child of another entity, you can use the method `addChild(prefab)`, which will instantiate the prefab and add it as a child:

```java
Entity sprite = parentEntity.addChild(spritePrefab);
```
