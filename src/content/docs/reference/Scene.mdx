Scenes are responsible for loading systems and entities into the world.

## Creating a Scene

```java
public class MyScene extends Scene {

	public MyScene() {
		super("MyScene");
	}

	@Override
	protected void load() {
		super.load();

		// Add systems and entities...
	}

}
```

## Loading a Scene

Each scene has a unique identifier (id). Scenes can be loaded by passing their id to `Application.loadScene(int sceneId)`.

```java
int mySceneId = myApplication.addScene(new MyScene());

myApplication.loadScene(mySceneId);
```
